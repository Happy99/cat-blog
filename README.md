This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project.

## My notes

### tech-stack:

- typescript
- Next.js
- Next router (pages)
- React
- bootstrap
- axios
- css (because modern CSS can do most from SCSS :D)

### If time allows

- storybook
- Jest test
- playwright (e2e)
- pipes - build test, vercel github deploy

- Why no Redux?
  - Next.js supports SSR a ISR. I would probably store just authentication.
    I dont see any other use right now.
